## Step 1
When you first run the code you will see something like this: 
Please type in the math operation you will like to complete
    + for addition
    - for subtraction
    * for multiplication
    / for division.
## Step 2
The user is supposed to type the first symbol from above.Eg: +,-,*,/.\
## Step 3
After that,you will see it will show you the sign that you choose and then  you will need to input your first number and then you input your second number.
## Step 4
Depending which sign you choose,if you say that you choose addition and then input two numbers(5 + 1) it willl show you something like this(5 + 4 =) then under it it will show the answer like this(9.0). 
## Step 5
After the answer,it will ask you if you want to continue. If you type y(yes) it will start again from step 1.Eg   Do you want to use the caculator again? 
    Please type y for yes and n for no
    y

If you said n(no) it will print see you later.E.g :
